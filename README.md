# Python Assignments Collection

## About This Repository
This repository contains **6 Python assignments** as part of my learning journey.  
Out of these, **4 assignments are built using Streamlit** to create interactive web apps, while the other 2 are console-based Python projects.

Each assignment focuses on different Python concepts including encryption, UI development, data handling, and object-oriented programming.
