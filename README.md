# Python Streamlit Projects by Hooria Khan

Welcome to my collection of **6 Python assignments** as part of my learning journey.  
Out of these, **4 are Streamlit-based interactive web apps**, and **2 are console-based Python projects**. Each assignment covers different Python concepts such as encryption, UI development, data handling, and object-oriented programming.
